Article: The best way of learning a language is by using it. The best way of learning English is using English as much as possible. Sometimes you will get your words mixed up and people won't understand. Sometimes people will say things too quickly and you can't understand them.
But if you keep your sense of humor( ),you can always have a good laugh at the mistakes you make.
Don't be unhappy if the people seem to  laugh at your mistakes. It's much better for people to laugh at your mistake than to be angry because they don't know what you are saying. The most important rule for learning English is "Don't be afraid of making mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes."

Question: When you make a mistake, you'd better   _  .
A. do the same thing again.
B. ask others for help.
C. have a sense of humor.

Article: On my first holiday in America, I went to a large supermarket to buy breakfast. And although this was an English-speaking country that I knew well through films and TV, I was amazed. Everything came in unfamiliar   packaging  ,with things I'd never heard of, Even things as simple as corn chips were strange, in different colours including black and purple.
Tilse, who works for Nutrition Australia, first realized there was a problem six years ago. After teachers at her children's school quietly shared their opinions about the diets, she knew something about it. "They cared for what many children were  bringing to school for lunch," she said. "Mostly packaged foods, such as chips are not healthy."
Tilse said, "They've managed to escape war areas and get to Australia, only to face the very real risk of running into heart disease. All because they're making wrong choices about food."
"Before I came to Australia, I'd never seen a sandwich," said Joseline Ntunzusenimanima, a 33-year-old mother of seven from Burundi in East Africa. "There were so many fruits I had either never seen or not been able to buy for many years. I was in shock for the first four days after I arrived. I didn't know what to do or where to go because I was just amazed to see plenty of food, peace and safety."

Question: What did the writer feel about the food when she visited the USA for the first time?
A. Happy.
B. Excited.
C. Amazed.
D. Comfortable.

Article: Ken and Anthony were childhood friends. They went to elementary and high school together. They went to college in different states, and then they lost touch. That was twenty years ago.
One morning Ken was reading the newspaper with his morning coffee. Inside he saw an announcement for a poetry reading at a nearby bookstore. He was surprised to find that the featured poet was none other than his friend Anthony. Ken decided to see what his old pal was up to.
Ken sat in the last row of the area set up inside the bookstore. When Anthony was introduced and came up the podium, Ken hardly recognized him. Anthony was almost completely bald and had a little potbelly  . When Anthony was in high school, he was very handsome. What Anthony had lost in looks was made up for in talent. Anthony's poetry was quite good.
Anthony recognized Ken sitting in the back row. When the reading was over, Ken stood in line with the others waiting for Anthony to sign a copy of his book. When it was Ken's turn, Anthony stood up and hugged his long lost friend. Anthony invited Ken to stay until he had finished signing books. Ken did, and the two men grabbed a cup of coffee at a nearby cafe.
Even though so many years had passed since the two had seen each other, both men had a lot in common. Both graduated from college with degrees in comparative literature  . Both went to graduate school. Anthony got his Master's of Fine Art in writing. Ken went to law school. Both men married Mexican women. Both men also had sons that were only a year apart.
