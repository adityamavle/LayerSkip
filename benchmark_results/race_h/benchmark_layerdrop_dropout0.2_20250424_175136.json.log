Article: "I believe you're the right person to write an advice column   for the students called Dear Amy!" Jenny, editor of the school newspaper, said to Andy, who finally agreed to accept the job if Jenny promised not to tell it to anyone else.
At first it wasn't too bad. Most of the letters he received were interesting and quite easy to answer. Then came a letter from a person named Joe.
"Dear Amy," it began, "I'm in real trouble. I've wanted to be a songwriter all my life, but my parents don't even let me take music lessons. I have a guitar, but they both get angry if I play. I've tried explaining, but they didn't listen. I feel sad. Should I run away from home? Maybe that will make my parents agree." The letter signed "Joe".
Andy thought about this letter for a long time. Should he advise someone to run away from home? Probably not. But didn't Joe have a right to be a songwriter if he wanted to? Andy thought hard, but couldn't think out a good answer. Andy couldn't sleep. He just worried about poor Joe.
At a bar a few days later, Eleanor, a girl in Andy's maths class, sat down next to him and asked, " What's wrong with you? You look a little worried."
"I guess I do," said Andy.
"If you get a problem, why don't you try writing to Dear Amy about it?" asked Eleanor.
Andy sighed. But Eleanor continued, "In fact, I guess Dear Amy is rather busy with other problems. She still hasn't answered the _ letter I wrote her last week. You'd better read it -- it may even make the most hard-hearted person cry! It was supposed to be from a songwriter named Joe."

Question: In the letter Joe says that   _  .
A. his parents don't know about music
B. his classmates don't understand him
C. he would stay away from his parents
D. he would obey his parents

Article: Snack time is a part of the day for children of all ages. But new research suggests that kids snacking in big groups could be at risk for _ .
Scientists from American University looked at the eating behavior of 54 kids between the ages of 2 and 6. At snack time, the scientist watched the amount of food each child ate while they were in groups of either three or nine. According to the study, the more children there are in a group, the more likely they are to eat more. Those in the larger group ate nearly 30 percent more than those in the smaller group, and they actually ate faster.
Since this is the first such study in children, scientists are quick to point out the importance of encouraging healthy habits in kids as early as possible.
"If you know kids eat more in large groups, it seems perfect to use this information to keep snack groups small or use small tables," says Dr. Jana Klauer, an expert in New York.
Smaller groups would allow for a quiet and more relaxing environment-a perfect chance to teach children about food, manners and how to know when they feel full. "This would have an effect on kids' eating," adds Klauer. "They would slow down and eat less."

Question: The best title of the passage is "_"
A. Snack Time
B. Different Groups
