Article: Do you know how to talk to others politely in English? Have a look at the following.
Could you give me five minutes? VS Go away.
You're really busy, but your classmate needs your help. When you're busy and can't help him or her, you can't say "Go away". And you can say, "Could you give me five minutes?"
Excuse me. VS Move
Telling someone to move out of the way is very rude . When someone is in your way, you should say "Excuse me".
I'm afraid I can't. VS No
It can often be difficult to _ an invitation from a friend. Saying "No" would be impolite. It's a good idea to say,"I'm afraid I can't." if you have to say no to an invitation.
Would you mind...? VS Stop it!
If someone is doing something rude, would you like them to stop? You shouldn't say, "Stop talking on your phone in the cinema!" You can say, "Would you mind not using your phone in the cinema, please?"

Article: One thing that British and Chinese cultures share is a love for fine tea. Today, when we think of western tea culture, we often think of the English and beautiful china cups.
Afternoon tea
People believe that an English lady, Anna, first introduced the idea of afternoon tea. In the 18thand 19thcenturies, the English are only two main meals each day ----breakfast and a heavy dinner that would last several hours in the evening. As a result, people often got very hungry during the long wait between these two meals. To solve this problem, Anna came up with the clever idea of inviting some friends to join her for an afternoon meal between four and five o`clock. This meal included cakes and sandwiches, and tea was served to wash down the food. In order to make this afternoon meal important,  fine china cups and plates, and silver teapots, forks and spoons were used. Soon, afternoon tea parties became popular social occasions. Today, afternoon tea parties continue to play an important part in the social life in the modern Britain.
Will you come for coffee?
Coffee also has an important role in British culture. People often use the words "Will you come for coffee?" to mean "Would you like to come to my home for a chat?"Normally, several different drinks such as tea, hot chocolate or a soft drink like orange juice will be served as well as coffee, and you will be asked what you would like. However, you will not normally be offered wine at a "coffee" party.
Coffeehouses and the London Stock Exchange 
In the 17thcentury London, coffeehouses were busy and noisy places. Businessmen and bankers went to coffeehouses to do their business, as well as to drink coffee. In fact, the London Stock Exchange is believed to have started from these coffeehouses.

Article: 20Today it is found that school students hardly pay much attention to sports. Is it because they aren't interested in sports? No. They often say they have other more important things to do.
What are these important things? Examinations! Students have to spend much time on all kinds of examinations at school. So many of them almost become bookworms  . Books stop them from doing sports. Because of the pressure from their parents and teachers, the students have to work harder and spend most of their time on books. As for (......) the students, they want to get good results so that they can improve their studies. So it is necessary for them to give all of their free time to their studies and stop their school sports.
In fact, education can't go without physical   exercises, because a quick mind hardly goes along with a weak body. If you don't have a strong body, you can never get anything, let alone   a great success in your life.

Question: which sentence is true?
A. If sudents want to get better results in studies, they must not do sports.
B. If students spend all their time on sports, they will improve studies.
C. If you have a weak body, you will have a hard mind.

Article: In Britain ,people often invite friends for a meal , a party or just coffee. People who know each other very well may visit each other's houses without  an invitation ,but if we invite new friends, usually an invitation is needed. When people invite someone to their homes , they often say ,"Would you like to come for dinner on Saturday ?" Answers are, "Thanks, we'd love to. What time?" or "I'm sorry, We'd love to ,but we have tickets for the concert." However, it is not polite to say,"No, we wouldn't."
Sometimes, the British use expressions that sound like invitations but which are not invitations. For example. "You must come over for a drink sometime ." or "Let's go out for a meal one of these days."  These are usually just polite ways of ending a talk . They are not real invitations because they don't mention an exact time or day. They just show that the person is trying to be friendly and the answers are ,"Yes , that would be nice ." or "OK, yes ,thanks."
So next time you hear what sounds like an invitation, listen carefully. Is it a real invitation or is the person just being friendly?

Question: It is not polite to answer the real invitation by saying "  _  "
A. Sorry. We'd love to, but we have tickets for the concert .
B. Thanks. We'd love to, what time?
C. Sure. We'd like to. Thanks a lot.
D. No, we wouldn't!
