But the moon is much closer to us than any star. That is why it looks so big. If you hold a coin close to your eye, it looks big. If you look at it across the moon, it looks small.
The moon moves around the earth. It makes one trip in about four weeks. The moon looks flat to us. But it is a round ball, like the earth.
People once thought the moon had fire on it. They thought the fire made it bright. Now we know the moon is like a mirror. It gets its light from the sun.
Our sunlight comes from the sun, too. What is the sun? The sun is a star. The stars we can see have their own light. There are many big stars we cannot see. Their light had burned out. Others are still bright, but they are so far away that we cannot see them. The sun looks bigger and much brighter than other stars because it is the nearest of all stars. The sun and the other stars we see are very hot, but the air around us saves us from the heat of the sun.
The sun gives us light and warmth. It makes plants grow and turns leaves green. It makes life possible on our earth. It is a life giving star.

A. can speak
B. can study it
C. can't study it
D. can't use it
Answer:

[Prompt]:
Article: What does it feel like to break a bone  ? It's different for everyone, but the pain is often sharp  . If the break is small, however, the person may not feel much pain at all. If you think that you or someone else has broken a bone, the most important things to do are to stay calm, make the hurt person comfortable, and call the doctor. Do not move the injured body part since movement could make it worse.
To treat the break, the doctor will need to take an X-ray. This gives the doctor the information he or she needs to set   the bone: to put it back to its normal place. If the bone is large or it is broken in more than one place, the doctor may need to use metal pins   to set it. After the bone has been set, the next step is usually putting on a cast, the special, hard thing that will keep the bone in place for a month or two.
Your bones are excellent at healing themselves. Broken bones will produce many new cells   and tiny blood vessels  . These cover both ends of the broken part, and close up the break until the bone is as whole and strong as before.

Question: Which of the following is the best title for the passage?
A. How to Know if a Bone is Broken
B. How Broken Bones Heal Themselves
C. Common Causes   of Broken Bones
D. What You Should Know about Broken Bones
