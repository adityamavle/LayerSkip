Article: In Britain ,people often invite friends for a meal , a party or just coffee. People who know each other very well may visit each other's houses without  an invitation ,but if we invite new friends, usually an invitation is needed. When people invite someone to their homes , they often say ,"Would you like to come for dinner on Saturday ?" Answers are, "Thanks, we'd love to. What time?" or "I'm sorry, We'd love to ,but we have tickets for the concert." However, it is not polite to say,"No, we wouldn't."
Sometimes, the British use expressions that sound like invitations but which are not invitations. For example. "You must come over for a drink sometime ." or "Let's go out for a meal one of these days."  These are usually just polite ways of ending a talk . They are not real invitations because they don't mention an exact time or day. They just show that the person is trying to be friendly and the answers are ,"Yes , that would be nice ." or "OK, yes ,thanks."
So next time you hear what sounds like an invitation, listen carefully. Is it a real invitation or is the person just being friendly?

Question: It's always necessary for  _  to visit each other's houses with an invitation.
A. close friends
B. family members
C. neighbours
D. new friends

Article: What does it feel like to break a bone  ? It's different for everyone, but the pain is often sharp  . If the break is small, however, the person may not feel much pain at all. If you think that you or someone else has broken a bone, the most important things to do are to stay calm, make the hurt person comfortable, and call the doctor. Do not move the injured body part since movement could make it worse.
To treat the break, the doctor will need to take an X-ray. This gives the doctor the information he or she needs to set   the bone: to put it back to its normal place. If the bone is large or it is broken in more than one place, the doctor may need to use metal pins   to set it. After the bone has been set, the next step is usually putting on a cast, the special, hard thing that will keep the bone in place for a month or two.
Your bones are excellent at healing themselves. Broken bones will produce many new cells   and tiny blood vessels  . These cover both ends of the broken part, and close up the break until the bone is as whole and strong as before.

Question: When someone breaks his bone, the following should be done except   _  .
A. asking the doctor for help
B. comforting the hurt person
C. moving the injured part
D. staying calm

Article: The scientists from the Lockheed Space Company   work in Felton, California, with the help of a computer. But the computer is placed in Sunnyside, about 80 kilometers away. What the scientists input is sent by telephone lines to the computer, and after a time, copies of the designs are needed back in Felton as possible. Lockheed people have tried several ways of sending the prints  , but the most effective seems to be by pigeon  . Are pigeons really used to carry messages in these days? They are, and they send the prints faster and cheaper than any other way.
Human   messengers (persons carrying messages) are much more expensive and slower than the pigeons. The road to Felton goes through the mountains, and the driving is not easy. An electronic printout system  could do the work in Felton, but at a cost of 10 dollars a print. Pigeons carry the designs for about 1 dollar each.
Now Lockheed people have ten pigeon messengers. The pigeons do the work, and they have made Lockheed more famous. You can often read the news about the pigeons in the newspapers around the world.

Question: This story is unusual because pigeons_.
A. don't like carrying things
B. are often cheap to keep
C. seem out of place in the space age
D. aren't friendly to the scientists

Article: Most people follow others blindly mainly under the effect of peer  pressure. Some people also feel it safe to follow a large number of people. In some _ cases it might be right to follow the crowd  , but in most cases this can be one big mistake. Ninety-five percent of people never succeed because they are following the wrong group. Actually there are reasons why we shouldn't follow the crowd blindly.  According to a study, people tend to follow the crowd when they aren't sure about the direction they should take. This means a large number of people could be following others without understanding what's right and what's wrong! This attracts more people to follow them and the result is that most people move in a certain direction even if it isn't right.
A man who wants to be successful always hopes for others' guidance and he usually follows the same path of most people, but the question this man never asks himself is: are all of those people successful? Of course not! If you want to follow a crowd, then follow a successful one. However, in real life you'll only find one successful person among hundreds of people, and that's why following the crowd makes no sense at all.
Most people act without thinking wisely. If you always follow others because
they're greater than you in number, then sooner or later you'll discover that you're
making decisions you might regret later.
However, should we never follow the crowd?No. I'm not trying to say you should never follow the crowd, but instead I'm just asking you to think wisely before you take a decision. If you find others are right, there is no problem in following them, but if you have doubts about the direction they're moving in, don't follow them blindly.

Question: A man who wants to succeed should  _  .
A. follow the crowd
B. follow others' guidance
C. follow a successful person
D. follow the same path of most people
