      "Article: Train-spotting\n",
      "Many people around the world have seen Danny Boyle's movie Train spotting starring Ewan McGregor, but how many of us really know what train-spotting is all about? Now this is not considered cool in town and the word \"train-spotter\" in Britain is related to \"geek\" or \"nerd\" (someone who seems very ridiculous). But is this reputation really deserved?\n",
      "First of all, let's see what train-spotting is. It is said that there are some 100,000 train spotters in the UK. Exactly as the title suggests, they spot trains, that is, they stand in train stations, look at the number of each train that leaves and arrives and write it down. The eventual aim is to have seen every train in the country.\n",
      "Being crazy about railways and trains is not modern and it dates back to 1804. As the number of trains grew and they got faster and faster, so did the interest in them grow? Is this any stranger than people who love cars?\n",
      "So, what do you need to be a train-spotter? Well, all you really need is a pen or pencil and a notebook to write down the train numbers. Other equipment  includes hot tea in a thermos, a camera and some sandwiches for those long afternoons spent on train platforms when you don't want to risk the delights of railway station food.\n",
      "It's interesting to note that despite the \"bad name\" of train-spotting, there have been famous railway lovers in history, such as Alfred Hitchcock, who filmed them regularly, especially The 39 Steps. There is evidence, too, that being a train-spotter is not necessarily a strange phenomenon in Britain.\n",
      "One glance at the US train stations should be enough to convince you that train-spotters there are alive and well. In America, they try to call rail lovers \"train-fans\" and talk of \"train-fanning\". Don't let this fool you--these people are train spotters and there are a lot of them.

      "Article: When you read an article you will understand and remember it better if you can work out how the writer has put the ideas together.Sometimes a writer puts ideas together by asking questions and then answering them.For example,if the article is about groundhogs ,the set of questions in the writer's head might be:\n",
      "What does a groundhog look like?\n",
      "Where do groundhogs live?\n",
      "What do they eat?...\n",
      "In the article,the author might answer those questions.\n",
      "Sometimes an author writes out her questions in the article.These questions give you signals.They tell you what the author is going to write next.Often an author has a question in her head but she doesn't write it out for you.You have to work out her question for yourself.Here's a sample reading for you to practice this method.\n",
      "Earthworms\n",
      "Do you know how many kinds of earthworms there are?There are about 1800 kinds in the world! They can be brown,purple,green.They can be as small as 3 cm long and as large as 3 m long.\n",
      "The best time to see earthworms is at night,especially a cool,damp night.That's when they come up from their burrows to hunt for food.Earthworms don't like to be in the sun.That's because they breathe through their skin,and they can't breathe if their skin gets too dry.Earthworms must come out of the earth if it rains a lot,because they can't breathe in their flooded burrows.What a dangerous life!\n",
      "Earthworms don't have eyes,so how can they tell when it's dark? They have special places on their skin that are sensitive to light.These spots tell whether it's light or dark.If you shine a flashlight on an earthworm at night,it will quickly disappear into the ground.\n",
      "Earthworms don't have ears either,but they can hear by feeling movements in the earth.If you want to hear like an earthworm,lie on the ground with your fingers in your ears.Then have a friend stamp his or her feet near you.This is how earthworms feel birds and people walking,and moles digging,near them.\n",
      "Earthworms are useful.Farmers and gardeners like having lots of earthworms in their land because the worms help to make better soil when they dig.That digging keeps the soil loose and airy .In one year earthworms can pile up as much as 23,000 kg of castings in an area about the size of a football field.\n",

      "In fact, happiness is always around you if you put your heart into it. When you are in trouble at school, your friends will help you; when you are studying hard at your lessons, your parents are always taking good care of you; When you get success, your friends will say congratulations to you; When you do something wrong, people around you will help you to correct it. All your happiness is always around you.\n",

However, the possibility of death for drivers between 30 and 59 decreases with each additional (added) passenger.\n",

A graduated license requires that a teenager first prove that he/she is able to drive in the presence of an adult, followed by a period of driving with a limited number of passengers, before graduating to full driving on his own. About half of the states now have some sort of graduated licensing system in place. The systems have reduced teenage driver crashes , according to recent studies.\n",

Allison realized that she spent her years finding her way: time well spent, and time we must all take if  we're being honest with ourselves. The only way to lead an interesting life is to face uncertainty and make a choice. Otherwise your life is not your own - it is a path someone else has chosen. Moments of uncertainty are when you create your life, and when you become who you are. Uncertainty usually begins with a job hunt, but it doesn't end there.

      "Article: Food is a major part of every culture. After all, everyone needs to eat! But each country has its own traditions on what people eat and when.\n",
      "Egypt\n",
      "Egyptians commonly start the day with a drink, sometimes going with bread. Breakfast can be eaten any time after this but before the day's main meal. In the past, this main meal was served at around 3:00 p.m. But now people work longer hours and eat when they get home at around 6:00 p.m. Dinner parties are held later, around 9:00 p.m.\n",
      "Most Egyptian meals include bread or ice, cooked vegetables and beans or meat.\n",
      "France\n",
      "France is known for its fine cooking, and its people take food seriously. Most eat three meals a day at fixed times and never snack between meals. Breakfast is a light meal of bread and coffee. They eat lunch at around 1:00 p.m. and a dinner with multiple courses after 8:00 p.m.\n",
      "The French consider eating a social activity. Eating alone is hard to see, and eating while doing something else is unheard-of. The French take time to enjoy their meals and visitors should do the same.\n",
      "Brazil\n",
      "Like the French, Brazilians usually eat a light breakfast. Lunch, the largest meal of the day, usually consists of meat, rice, potatoes, beans and vegetables. Between 6:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m., people enjoy a smaller meal with their families.\n",

      "American's ancestors came from many countries, so American eating habits differ. Some take time to prepare and eat a hot breakfast. Others take a bagel   while rushing out the door or just _ . For lunch, most Americans eat a sandwich or leftovers. Traditionally, families got together for a large evening meal around 6:00, but now busy schedules force many families to eat in turns. American restaurant servings tend to be huge. But you don't have to finish them; taking leftovers home is common.\n",

So scientists were trying hard to find ways to make pictures that can move. They made lots of experiments, but failed again and again. It was Eadweard Muybridge who finally succeeded. He was the first photographer to try this successfully. But how did he make it? It was an interesting story.\n",
      "Back in 1872, people didn't know exactly whether all four of a horse's hooves   left the ground at the same time when it was running. A gentleman called Leland Stanford made a bet with his friend about it. Most people believed that a horse always had one hoof on the ground, or it would fall over. But Stanford didn't think so.\n",
      "At that time, it was hard to know who could win the bet, because a horse's legs move so fast that it is impossible to tell just by looking. So they needed a way to record the movement of a running horse. Then Stanford offered $25,000 to the famous photographer, Muybridge, to help find the answer. In the beginning, Muybridge failed to get clear images, but he didn't give up. He continued to improve his cameras. In 1878, after many experiments, he managed to get a sequence   of 12 photos. One of them clearly showed that all four of the horse's hooves were off the ground at the same time. And when the photos moved fast, people could see a horse running.\n",

      "Article: The resignation letter of Gu Shaoqiang, a teacher from Henan, \"The world is so big; I want to see it.\" is very popular in the Internet. Many people say that it spoke the minds of millions of people who feel they have been in a boring and normal life and want to do something different to change it. Whatever the teacher may be able to achieve with her life, it is meaningful for people to make their dream come true.\n",
      "So, what is your opinion? Should we praise the teacher for resigning and following her dreams?\n",
      "Yes---All of us have dreams that can't come true right now.\n",
      "First, Too many people waste their lives by doing things they don't love simply because it is what people expect them to do. They are not happy and they also affect  people around them. The earlier they can break free, the more meaning they can make out of their lives.\n",
      "Second, It is a waste of people's talents and social resources  if they don't get to do the things they are most talented at. Some people don't want to be white-collar workers all their lives. They should have the freedom to change their lives.\n",
      "Third, As our country develops so fast, people have greater freedom to change their lives as long as they put in the time and effort. The teacher is a good example.\n",
      "No---People can't change their lives overnight.\n",
      "First, \"Seeing the world\" is not good enough an excuse to leave one's job and life. This kind of attitude could actually be a bad example for young people.\n",
      "Second, Everyone has a place in society and life. People may not have achieved their wildest or most ambitious dreams, but where they end up is the result of their and society's decisions. Unless they offer to make lots of efforts and sacrifices, people can't change their lives _ \n",

There are more countries where people seem to be living nearly _ each other because conditions are overcrowded . Then there are others where it seems that hardly anybody lives. What influences this unequal distribution of people ? There are specific advantages and disadvantages of living in a certain area.\n",
      "The two main factors   that influence people's choice of location are climate and resources. Climate is the usual weather conditions in a region. Areas that have bad weather are generally less ideal as places to live in . The north and south poles at the top and bottom of the world may be beautiful in their rugged, natural way , but the disadvantage of the bitterly cold and windy conditions usually keeps people away. When it comes to climates, warm conditions and a normal amount of rainfall are advantages that attract people.\n",
      "Natural resources are tings that we get from nature that help us survive. Each region offers different resources, and therefore attracts different groups of people. People who enjoy the beach can make their living by catching and selling the ocean's many fish and other sea creature. Those who prefer farming can take advantage of rich soil in valleys near rivers. Some people are willing to accept the disadvantages of the terrible conditions of deserts or mountains in order to take advantages of the resources like oil or woods.\n",

      "Afternoon tea\n",
      "People believe that an English lady, Anna, first introduced the idea of afternoon tea. In the 18thand 19thcenturies, the English are only two main meals each day ----breakfast and a heavy dinner that would last several hours in the evening. As a result, people often got very hungry during the long wait between these two meals. To solve this problem, Anna came up with the clever idea of inviting some friends to join her for an afternoon meal between four and five o`clock. This meal included cakes and sandwiches, and tea was served to wash down the food. In order to make this afternoon meal important,  fine china cups and plates, and silver teapots, forks and spoons were used. Soon, afternoon tea parties became popular social occasions. Today, afternoon tea parties continue to play an important part in the social life in the modern Britain.\n",

      "In January 2004, the APOPO started this project. First, the trainers let the 4-week-old baby rats get familiar with humans. A few weeks later, the rats were no Ionger afraid of people and 'the things around them. Then they were trained to connect a click* sound with food. After the rats had leamed that, the trainers then taught them to tell the difference between the smell of mines and other smells. When the rats could do it, the click was sounded and they were given a bit of banana.  The method was called clicker training. \"The training isn't easy, said trainer Abdullah Mchomvu.  \"You have to be patient. Sometimes I get angry, but then again, I tell myself these are animals.\"\n",
      "After nine months'training, the rats were taken to a minefield. They'ran across the minefield, stopped, sat and scratched the ground to tell the deminers*  that they smelt out'a mine.

It is difficult and dangerous to clear these rnines, About 50  people including many children were' killed 'or htirt each iay.  In 2003,  APOPO,  a Dutch research com pan y that uains the an imals, came up with the-idea of s\\ng rats to search for the mines.\n",
      "The animal trainers 'found that a kind of rats from Africa were clever and had.a sharp*  sense of smell.  The rats were about 75 cm long and.weighed about l.35 kg, light enough to run across a minefield without setting off the mines.\n",
      "In January 2004, the APOPO started this project. First, the trainers let the 4-week-old baby rats get familiar with humans. A few weeks later, the rats were no Ionger afraid of people and 'the things around them. Then they were trained to connect a click* sound with food. After the rats had leamed that, the trainers then taught them to tell the difference between the smell of mines and other smells. When the rats could do it, the click was sounded and they were given a bit of banana.  The method was called clicker training. \"The training isn't easy, said trainer Abdullah Mchomvu.  \"You have to be patient. Sometimes I get angry, but then again, I tell myself these are animals.\"\n",
      "After nine months'training, the rats were taken to a minefield. They'ran across the minefield, stopped, sat and scratched the ground to tell the deminers*  that they smelt out'a mine.  Then the mine was cleared. It had  taken two 'deminers  a day to clear a 200m2 . minefield, but with the help of two rats 'they could finish it in two hours.\n",
      "The rats and the deminers saved thousands of lives, \"The rats did this job much better than we expected. So far they have helped to make almost 2,000,000m2 of land safe. They are heroes,\" said Bart Weeqens, the head of the APOPO.\n",
